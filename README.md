## 📌 About the Project

## 💡 How It Works
1. The user enters a task in the input field and clicks **Add** or presses **Enter**.  
2. The JavaScript code creates a new list item dynamically in the **task list**.  
3. Each task has **complete** and **delete** buttons for easy management.  
4. Completed tasks are visually distinguished using **CSS styling** (like strikethrough).  
5. Tasks can be removed individually by clicking the **delete icon**.
